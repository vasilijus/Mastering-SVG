<!-- 
    Measuring and subdividing the curve -  The JavaScript language binding of SVG allows you
to interrogate properties of things that have been drawn either through markup or dynami-
cally, and to manipulate them using methods. In this case, we are using two function calls:
L = B.getTotalLength(); and P = B.getPointAtLength(L * i / n);. The first measures the path, B,
and returns a numeric value; the second returns a point (an object with both x and y values)
a given fraction of the distance along B. Script is then used to create new ellipses of different
colors at those fractional mileposts.
