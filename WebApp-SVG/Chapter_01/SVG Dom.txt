SVG DOM
To those who have not already programmed with the DOM in HTML or XML, this topic can be fairly
complex. As you read this chapter, we encourage you to spend a week or two playing with some of
these examples and others at the authors’ websites (for example, see http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david​
.dailey/svg/createElementBrowser.html). If you are not already a programmer, you may want to skip
this section.
To recap, the following two lists show topics that have already been covered in this chapter and
those that have not, respectively. Once you become familiar with all of these concepts, you will be
able to do most anything you will ever need to do in the SVG DOM.

Here are the topics that we’ve already covered:
■ ■ setAttributeNS()
■ ■ getAttributeNS()
■ ■ getElementById()
■ ■ createElementNS()
■ ■ appendChild()
■ ■ cloneNode()
■ ■ firstChild

And here are the topics that we’ll discuss in the final sections of the chapter:
■ ■ previousSibling() and nextSibling()
■ ■ getElementsByTagNameNS()
■ ■ parentNode()
■ ■ removeChild()
■ ■ createTextNode()
